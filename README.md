## 🔍 Key Calculations
Some of the calculated measures used in the report:

Age = YEAR(TODAY()) - 'marketing_data'[Year_Birth]

Total Spend =
    'marketing_data'[MntWines] +
    'marketing_data'[MntFruits] +
    'marketing_data'[MntMeatProducts] +
    'marketing_data'[MntFishProducts] +
    'marketing_data'[MntSweetProducts] +
    'marketing_data'[MntGoldProds]

High Value Customer =
    IF([Total Spend] > AVERAGE('marketing_data'[Total Spend]), "Yes", "No")
